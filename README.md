Data analysis and visualisation associated with the paper "Suppression of Wolbachia-mediated male-killing in the butterfly Hypolimnas bolina involves a single genomic region"

In the spirit of open and reproducible science, I have provided code that permits replication of analysis performed for the above paper. Analysis is performed using data published in the supplementary materials section of the paper, the path to which is included and pointed to in the code. 

Code was updated and tested using R version 4.4.1 (2024-06-14 ucrt) -- "Race for Your Life". 

I have used the renv package to enable the project to be run in a reproducible environment.
